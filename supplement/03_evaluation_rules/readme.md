# 03 evaluation rules

**Authority and reading order:** `eval_protocol.md` is the only normative protocol in this directory and MUST be read first. All other files are subordinate references and MUST NOT introduce additional rules or override the protocol.

This directory defines evaluation **contracts** only.

- It contains **no experimental results**.
- It has **no dependency** on `tools/` or `supplement/04_results/`.
- Tooling documents are **archival** and do not affect evaluation semantics.
