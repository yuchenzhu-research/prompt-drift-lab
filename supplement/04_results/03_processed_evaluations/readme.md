# supplement/04_results/03_processed_evaluations — Processed evaluations

This directory stores **deterministic, derived artifacts** produced from preserved judge outputs.

- Source inputs: `/supplement/04_results/02_raw_judge_evaluations/`
- No PDFs are parsed during processing.
- No text is reinterpreted; processing operates only on judge JSON bundles and recorded metadata.

## Layout

Each judge run is written to its own subdirectory:

- `/supplement/04_results/03_processed_evaluations/<judge_version>/`

Within a `<judge_version>` directory:

- Per-record audit trail:
  - `valid_evaluations/**/record_*.json`
- Derived summary tables (paper-cites):
  - `summary_tables/scores_long.csv`
  - `summary_tables/scores_grouped.csv`
  - `summary_tables/excluded_records.jsonl`
  - `summary_tables/run_meta.json`

The CSV files in `summary_tables/` are the primary inputs for reporting and analysis.

## Provenance and regeneration rules

- Every `record_*.json` is generated from raw judge bundles under:
  - `/supplement/04_results/02_raw_judge_evaluations/`
- Each record corresponds to exactly one evaluated file.
- `record.file` preserves the evaluated file identifier from the raw judge bundle.
  - **v0**: `record.file` is a bundle-side identifier and is not required to be a repository-relative path (it may include spaces and may omit the model subdirectory).
  - **v1/v2**: `record.file` is stored as a repository-relative PDF pointer under `supplement/04_results/01_raw_model_outputs/` for direct lookup.
- Records and tables are generated by scripts in `/supplement/tools/`.

Records are regenerated **only when input artifacts or validity conditions change**. Previously validated records are preserved and are not overwritten.
