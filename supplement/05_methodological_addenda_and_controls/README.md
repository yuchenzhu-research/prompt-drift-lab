# 05 Methodological Addenda and Controls

This directory contains supplementary methodological materials that define
assumptions, control decisions, and comparison boundaries that are not fully
expanded in the main paper.

The documents in this directory do not introduce new experimental results
and do not modify evaluation protocols or scoring rules. They clarify the
methodological context under which reported results should be interpreted.
