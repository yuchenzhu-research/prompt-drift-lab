# ANONYMIZATION_CHECKLIST

This package is intended for double-blind review.

## Must-pass checks
- [ ] No author names, affiliations, emails, or personal links in `paper/paper.pdf`.
- [ ] No author names, affiliations, emails, or personal links in supplemental files.
- [ ] No identity strings in filenames (e.g., usernames, real names).
- [ ] No OS-specific junk (`__MACOSX/`, `.DS_Store`).
- [ ] No API keys or access tokens in any script, config, or log file.

## Verification note
Basic local checks were performed to ensure compliance with anonymization requirements.
